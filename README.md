## Live Application

This application can be viewed here: N/A

## Description

This application simulates the process of creating cryptocurrency transactions where the user has the capability to create wallets and send transactions to other wallets. The usage of a cryptographic hash function validates the transactions and blocks of the chain. Furthermore, there is a section for attempting to alter the chain, which allows the user the opportunity to view the application's validation functions in action.

This application is NOT meant to be used for real-world usage. This is simply a simulation used for educational purposes. Highly detailed transaction and block details are recorded for the user to view and learn about cryptographic technology and it's efficacy in transactional validation.

This application is based off of the following project:
